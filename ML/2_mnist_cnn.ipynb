    "The procedure for constructing a convolutional neural network is the same as for a dense (fully-connected) neural network. Convolutional layers (`Conv2D`) can be added one-by-one, with pooling layers (`MaxPooling2D`) in between to condense the data size. With `Conv2D`, we have to specify the number of filters, the size of the kernel, the type of activation, and the rules handling boundaries. In the example below, each layer has 32 filters, a kernel size of 3x3 (`kernel_size=3`), and ReLU activation. The boundaries will be treated such that the size of the output is the same as the input (`padding=\"same\"`). After 3 convolutional layers, we squash the input and feed it into a single fully-connected layer with softmax activation."

    "Note that the total number of parameters is only a third of what we had in the case of only fully-connected layers, even though we have more layers. This is because convolutional layers \"reuse\" their parameters when going through the input data, and so the number of parameters does not depend on the size of the input. The number of parameters for a single convolutional layer can be calculated as $ \\left(K_w \\times K_l \\times C_{in} + 1 \\right) \\times C_{out}$, where $K_w$ and $K_l$ are the kernel width and length, $C_{in}$ is the number of input channels, and $C_{out}$ is the number of output channels. The $+1$ accounts for the biases that are added to each output channel. So for the first layer, we have $\\left(3 \\times 3 \\times 1 + 1 \\right) \\times 32 = 320$ parameters, and for the second and third layers we have $\\left(3 \\times 3 \\times 32 + 1 \\right) \\times 32 = 9248$ parameters each. The fully-connected layers takes an input of size $7 \\times 7 \\times 32 = 1568$, and produces an output of size $10$, so there are $1568 \\times 10 + 10 = 15,690$ weights and biases involved in the last layer.\n",
